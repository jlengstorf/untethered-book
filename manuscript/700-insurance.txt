# Look into Insurance and General Ass-Covering {#insurance}

Just like when you're living in one place, it's a good idea to have a few safety measures in place. Sure, you can live by the seat of your pants, but when your roof starts to leak (or your luggage disappears), it's nice to know you're not *entirely* up a creek.

So this section goes over some travel-specific areas of insurance and general ass-covering. All stuff that you'll *hopefully* never need, but you'll be glad to have in the unlikely event you do.

## Get Travel Health Insurance {#insurance-travel}

A travel health insurance policy is important, because it covers a lot of things that a standard policy typically doesn't. For example, medical evacuation isn't something you'll see on a standard insurance policy — but if you end up pretty sick in a developing country, you'll want to be evacuated.

Another, albeit more grisly, benefit is the repatriation of remains. If the worst happens, you don't want your family to end up spending a fortune trying to get you back home.

There are several options for travel health insurance. I ended up using [GeoBlue](http://bit.ly/1FTpbXJ) because I liked the benefits-to-cost comparison,[^health] and it's in the Blue Cross Blue Shield network.

[^health]:
    Honestly, I almost never go to the doctor. I've been to a walk-in clinic a couple times in the last four years. Aside from that, I went to the emergency room once when I was 99% sure I was going to die from food poisoning; the doctor told me — I'm paraphrasing here — to rub some dirt on it and quit whining, then sent me a bill for $1,400.

## Consider a Supplemental Insurance Plan for Your Gear {#insurance-gear}

Something I looked into before leaving was a plan to cover my valuables: my laptop, phone, and so on.

This turned out to be pretty tricky — every quote I got back was insanely expensive for what it would cover.

So in my case, I decided to skip insurance on my gear. Instead, I set aside an all-my-shit-got-stolen fund, which will replace everything I absolutely need in order to keep going.

Now, this makes sense for me, because replacing my essentials — a laptop, a phone, and some clothing — would cost me about $3,000 tops. So if you're traveling with $30K in video equipment, an insurance policy is probably worth researching.

But if you're like me, rolling with nothing more valuable than a MacBook Pro, a cash reserve may hold its value better than a supplemental insurance plan.

## Keep an Emergency Bailout Fund {#insurance-bailout}

I'm a firm believer in [setting yourself on fire](http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/). I think setting yourself on a do-or-die course is a great way to make sure you follow through on a commitment.

However, I'm also not about to put myself at risk of running out of money in Cambodia with no way to get home and no legal way of remaining in the country.

So I've put aside an emergency bailout fund. It's a few grand, which I look at as my emergency parachute. If I have to touch that, it's time to go home. If I'm going to go broke, I want to make sure I do it in a country where I can start applying for jobs without fear of deportation.

The bailout fund will ideally cover a flight home and a week or two of accommodations.[^emergency-fund]

[^emergency-fund]:
    This is not to be crossed up with a standard emergency fund, which gives you operating capital for a few months. The bailout fund is only intended to keep you out of a situation that could turn legally ugly, like going broke in a country where you can't legally work.

If you ignore everything else in this section, *do this*. Don't leave without a bailout fund in place.

## Keep Photos of Critical Documents in the Cloud {#insurance-cloud}

You never want to be without your ID documents. The problem with physical documents, though, is that they can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

So keep a secure copy of your documents somewhere in the cloud, where you can get to them on any computer with internet access. Use Dropbox, Google Drive, your email — anything that allows you to get to those docs even if everything you own is stolen.

What I'm currently using is [1Password](http://bit.ly/1Pbi7eg), which is fantastic for securely managing passwords,[^spy-movie] credit card information, bank accounts, ID documents, and anything else you want to keep encrypted. I have it on both my laptop and my phone, and it syncs with Dropbox.

[^spy-movie]:
    Tools like 1Password have ruined the spy movie genre for future generations:

    The hero is tied to a chair. The villain weilds some horrible instrument of pain. In an ominously accented growl, he demands, "Tell me ze password, Mr. Bond."

    And the hero will say, "I can't. It was randomly generated by my password manager."

    *[sickening sound of something awful happening, followed by tortured cries]*

    "What do you expect me to do," the hero manages to retort through gritted teeth, "take a wild guess at a randomly generated password with 128 bits of entropy?!"

    "No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die."

In many cases, I've found my passport number — not the passport itself — is all anyone is after, which saves me the hassle of carrying my passport around all the time. Since I've got my passport info encrypted in my phone, I can just pull it up quickly.

In addition to storing my passport data in 1Password, I keep a scanned image of my passport in Dropbox as well. I probably have this out of sheer paranoia, honestly, but I figure it can't hurt.

## Back Up Files Using a Cloud Service {#insurance-backup}

Sometimes shit happens. Once I dumped an entire cup of coffee into the keyboard of my laptop, killing it instantly. Another time I dropped my phone with surgical precision to land screen-down on a pointy rock, also killing it instantly. Another time I was so worried about dropping my (new) phone in the toilet that I set it on the sink, where it fell in, got wet, and was killed instantly.

In each of those cases, I stood to lose important things: my laptop has all of my work files on it; my phone has contact information, photos, messages, and music.

But I back up all my files to the cloud (automatically), so in all three of the above cases, I was only out the device, not the data.

Wrecking a laptop sucks — it's a really stupid way to spend money — but losing the data would have threatened my career. My clients' files all would have needed to be rebuilt; that's not time I get to bill for. So I lose months of work, and have to make it all up — without falling behind in the process. In the world of a business owner, permanently losing client data is Doomsday Scenario #1, and recovery is unlikely.

For that reason, it's *critical* to install some kind of automated cloud backup. I prefer [Dropbox](https://db.tt/gPmxlbE) because it's incredibly easy and reasonably priced, but there are multiple options out there, including [Google Drive](http://bit.ly/1NCtxsx) and [iCloud](http://apple.co/1PbkZYz).

If you're concerned about privacy, there are options to [beef up security on cloud storage](http://bit.ly/1PbnYQJ).

Once you set this up, your files will be automatically synced up to the cloud. This has the added benefit of allowing you to edit a document on your phone and have those edits immediately and automatically show up on your laptop.

It's an hour or so of hassle to set it up, and then you're just... done. And you don't have to worry about it again.

When I dumped coffee on my laptop, I swore loudly, went to Best Buy, bought a new laptop, installed Dropbox, and I was back up and running by the end of the day. Instead of days, weeks, or months of lost work, I was only out a few hours.

Cloud backups. Get 'em.

## Turn On Two-Factor Authentication for Your Accounts {#insurance-2fa}

If you've never heard of [two-factor authentication](http://bit.ly/1V21JE2) before, don't worry. You've probably already used it. You know how sometimes when you log into your bank or social accounts, they'll text you an authorization code? That's two-factor authentication.

The reason it's important is because while you're traveling, you never know which open wifi network has some shitbag connected that's eavesdropping on network traffic. It's really hard to be sure that someone hasn't gotten hold of your information.

However, it's pretty tough for someone to steal both your phone *and* all your passwords. So using two-factor authentication just adds an additional layer of hassle for would-be data thieves, which is typically enough to discourage them. Why bother with two-factor authentication when you can go after the people who haven't turned it on instead?

Time-wise, it's a minor inconvenience: most apps will use Google Authenticator, which means you enter your password, then check the app for a six-digit code to confirm you have your device with you. Other services will text you or call you — if you use your Google Voice number as the confirmation number, you can verify those services anywhere in the world.

Check your accounts — especially your email, social, and bank accounts — and turn on two-factor authentication in the settings. If you're not sure how, a quick Google search or help chat will get you pointed in the right direction.

This is a good idea whether or not you're traveling, so take the time to set it up today. These days, letting someone take over your email account is probably more destructive than letting them have your social security number — they can reset all your passwords, lock you out of all your accounts, and generally wreak utter havoc on your on- and offline existence. Don't take the chance.

## Use a VPN While Browsing the Internet {#insurance-vpn}

A VPN, or *virtual private network*, is a way to encrypt all your information that's sent through the internet. In short, it makes sure that if you're on an open wifi network, someone with sinister intentions can't intercept the things you're sending and receiving from your browser.

The reason most people get a VPN is to work around geographical restrictions on sites like Netflix, but they're worth much more than that.

I use [TunnelBear](http://bit.ly/1V22vRf) because it's cheap and really easy to use on both my laptop and phone. Plus they have all sorts of bear animations, and I like bears.

## Keep Original Documents Somewhere Safe {#insurance-original-documents}

Documents you don't need — birth certificate, Social Security card, etc. — shouldn't be kept in your luggage. Put them in a lockbox at a bank, in a loved one's safe, or with your lawyer or accountant for safekeeping.

If someone steals your passport, it's best that they don't also have all of your other ID documents as well.

Outside the U.S., most ID documents won't help you much anyways, so don't take the risk of carrying your entire identity paper trail in one bag.

## Set Up Mail Forwarding, Not a P.O. Box {#insurance-mail-forwarding}

For some services, like bank accounts, you can't use a P.O. box. So just setting up a P.O. box before you leave may put you in a tough spot later on.

You can easily work around that, though, by setting up a mail forwarding service.

I found a local place in Washington that offered a "virtual mailbox" service, which essentially means my mail goes to them, and they forward it wherever I tell them to. For now, I forward my mail to my parents, which is fine because I've received about one piece of mail every three months that actually requires any action.

If you don't want to burden your family and friends, there are companies that do this for you, including scanning mail, shredding items, and other mail-related tasks. I haven't used them myself, but some of the popular choices are [Traveling Mailbox](http://bit.ly/1V23yRa), [Mailbox Forwarding](http://bit.ly/1V23C3F), and [Earth Class Mail](http://bit.ly/1V23D7H).

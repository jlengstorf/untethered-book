-# Intro

# I Used to Be a Workaholic

I'm writing this introduction from Koh Samui, Thailand. I'm coming up on the one-year anniversary of giving up my lease in the United States and boarded a one-way flight out of the country.

Technically, I'm homeless.

I don't have a lease in Thailand (or anywhere else, for that matter), and I don't own any property. In fact, all I own is a suitcase-load of clothes, a bagful of electronics, and a TSA-sized bottle of Angostura bitters.

Since my job only requires an internet connection, I've been able to live in a half-dozen countries across three continents, all while working remotely as a contractor for U.S.- and Canadian-based companies.

Right now, I'm living a life I dreamed about when I was younger: I'm free to go where I please, to explore the world, and to control my own time — and I make a good living while I'm doing it.

However, this is a new development for me. Only a few short years ago, I was a severe workaholic. I was my own boss — the business was registered in my name, at least — but I was working 70- to 90-hour weeks, never far from my email, and utterly neglecting every aspect of my life that wasn't work. Worst of all, I told myself it was a healthy sense of ambition that led me to ignore my failing health and relationships in the name of "staying busy" at work.

This book is about travel, not working, so I won't go into too much detail, but I think it's important to set the tone for what we're actually dealing with here. I wasn't always able to travel, or to work remotely, or to control my schedule the way that I can today. I had to work hard to get to this point.

For me, it wasn't until my body *literally started falling apart* that I realized something needed to change and decided to put in the effort. Here's an excerpt from an article I wrote in early 2015, called [*The Cult of Work You Never Meant to Join*](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a), in which I realized I was not only keeping myself from living the life I wanted, but actually doing physical harm to myself:

> At the end of 2012, I landed the biggest project of my career at that point: a Black Friday sales site for a Fortune 100 company.
>
> I was thrilled and terrified. A project like this had the potential to move my company to the next level, and I decided to do whatever it took to make this project the best I’d ever built.
>
> The designers had great ideas, and I sat with them to make sure they were possible on our timeline. We came up with a slick, modern idea built on cutting-edge technology. The client loved it.
>
> Then bureaucracy came into play. The legal department made changes. Brand adherence contradicted legal. Design went over schedule. *Way* over schedule.
>
> By the time the design was approved, I had a third of the time we’d scheduled. And — since this was a Black Friday site — we couldn’t push back the release date. **It either launched on time or I was a failure.** Period.
>
> Not to be defeated, I powered through four straight days leading up to Black Friday, sleeping *maybe* six hours total. On Thanksgiving Day I skipped family get-togethers in favor of making the final push.
>
> I was exhausted. Delirious. But, goddammit, *I finished the project*.
>
> The client was thrilled. The site won a couple Addy Awards. I assume they made a metric fuckton in holiday sales.
>
> ![May, 2013 — about six months after my Black Friday fiasco.](/images/overwork-stress-unhealthy.jpg)
>
> Over the next few months, patches of my beard started to turn white. The whiskers became ultra-fine. Then they fell out altogether.
>
> Shortly afterward, I lost my ability to grow a beard entirely — I was left with the unsavory choice between a clean-shaven “giant fat baby” look and a creepy mustache.
>
> I had stressed myself out so badly that my body had forgotten how to grow a beard. And for what? So I could work 19-hour days and skip family holidays to meet crazy deadlines?
>
> I was exhausted. My body was failing. I was overwhelmed and unhappy and isolated. *I had a mustache, for chrissakes.*
>
> I had been guzzling the Overkill Cult’s Kool-Aid.
>
> Something had to change.
>
> ***
>
> When my beard died in 2013, I feared it was only the first sign of an impending decline in my health that would ultimately kill me. It was a glimpse into my future, and I was terrified that if I didn’t change, I was in for a life of isolation, ulcers, alopecia, and an eventual heart attack or stress-induced brain tumor.
>
> By changing my lifestyle, I was able to turn things around. After just a year of balancing my work with the rest of my life, my beard grew back. I lost 30 pounds because I was actually going outside and making it to the gym. I felt more awake, and I [became more positive](https://medium.com/@jlengstorf/stop-glossing-over-the-good-stuff-b89e25f7c714).
>
> When I left the Overkill Cult, *everything* in my life improved. Not one single thing got worse.

## My Decision to Die With No Regrets

Once I realized that I'd been letting my career rule the rest of my life, I started examining the decisions I'd made, and the situation I was living in.

My life was pretty good, really, but it wasn't the life I wanted. I always told myself I wanted to see the world, to have adventures, to *live* instead of dream. And now that I'd decided to take back control of my own destiny, I had no excuse not to follow the path I *wanted* instead of staying on the path I was on.

In mid-2014, I made the decision to die with no regrets.

I booked a one-way ticket to Milan, Italy — it was the cheapest I found — and started the process of selling off everything I owned. By late 2014 I was down to only those possessions I could fit in an overhead bin. On December 30, 2014, I turned in the key to the apartment I'd leased in Portland, climbed in a taxi with my suitcase and my girlfriend, Marisa, and headed for the airport, for parts unknown, toward the answers to all my what-ifs and I-wonders.

The ride hasn't let me down since.

## I Want to Help You Live the Life You Want

My decision to walk away from everything I knew, everyone I loved,[^gf] and (almost) everything I owned was one of the most challenging I've ever made. I had to break down a few decades' worth of false assumptions, cultural pressures, and deap-seated fears before I could book my ticket. And even then, every day between booking the ticket and boarding the plane, I would consider backing out.

[^gf]:
    Except Marisa, who's been the best traveling companion I could ask for.

Knowing how hard that decision was for me, I want to do what I can to make your decision easier.

I can't reach into your mind and make you believe that you're capable of living the life of your dreams (you are) or that traveling the world isn't as hard or expensive or scary as you might think (it's not) or that you can find remote sources of income in almost any field (you can); you'll have to come to realize all that for yourself.

However, I *can* share what I've learned from living a nomadic lifestyle in hopes that your own travel is less stressful. And that's the goal of this book: I want to share with you the gear and tools that I use to travel comfortably, the strategies that keep my stress low, and a little bit of philosophy that keeps me sane — even while I'm living a lifestyle that most people would call "crazy".

I can't do the work for you, but I can try to smooth the path a bit. And I sincerely hope that I can give you a nudge in the right direction, so you can find your way to your own "crazy" lifestyle, where you can live on your own terms and your own schedule.

# Disclaimers and Disclosures Before We Get Started

Bear in mind that the items and strategies laid out in this book are what I use — this is not the *only* way, or necessarily the "right" way; this is what works for me. Use your best judgment, consult professionals where applicable, and feel free to [get in touch](http://lengstorf.com/contact/) with questions.

Some of the content in this book deals with taxes. **I am not a tax expert, and none of what I'm saying in this book should be taken as expert advice.** This is what I'm doing, and to the best of my knowledge it's accurate and legal. However, you should talk to a professional before you try any of the financial stuff I talk about. Spend the money on an accountant. Don't fuck with your taxes; it's not worth it if something goes wrong.

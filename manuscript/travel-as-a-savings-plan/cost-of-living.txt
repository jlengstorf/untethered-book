# Travel as a Savings Plan

If you needed to cut your expenses by, say, about a thousand dollars each year, how would you go about it?

Most people start by cutting back on going out to eat, avoiding online shopping, or creating a stringent budget to control expenses.

But it turns out there’s a much easier way to cut your expenses by 10% or more: *start traveling the world*.

## Living Abroad Is Cheaper than a Lease

To understand why it's cheaper to live abroad, let's do some quick math.[^math]

Start by making a list of all the bills you pay that are related to your living arrangement.

As an example, when I lived in Missoula, Montana — which has a pretty low cost of living — my monthly bills looked like this:

1.  Rent: $675
2.  Electric: $100
3.  Gas/Water/Sewer: $35
4.  TV/Internet: $125
5.  Renter's Insurance: $25
6.  Biweekly Cleaning Service: $160[^cleaning]

These are the bills that applied specifically to *living* somewhere. I'm not counting food, mobile phone, gym memberships, or other expenses that don't relate specifically to keeping myself indoors and comfortable.

After combining all the additional bills associated with housing, it turns out I wasn't spending just $675 each month. **My actual cost of living was $1,120/month.**

## The Secret of the Shared Economy

When you decide to leave your lease behind and start traveling permanently, something magical happens: *all the extra bills go away.*

![This apartment in Prague costs less than $700/month — wifi and utilities included.](/images/prague-airbnb.jpg)

When you search for an apartment in Prague for a month on Airbnb, there are more than 300 listings you can rent for less than $1,120/month.

"But wait," you say, "your rent was only $675 before — isn't that *way more expensive*?"

It's not. It's *cheaper*,[^cheaper] and here's why:

When you rent a place through the shared economy, all of the additional costs are included. Renting an apartment in Prague for $900/month *includes* electricity, internet, utilities, and sometimes even a regular cleaning.[^airbnbcleaning]

So $900/month means $900/month. Not $900 *plus* a bunch of extra living costs. You end up with a $220/month savings over your rent-plus-other-living-costs price in Montana.

## What If I Want to Stay in Singapore?

Some places are extremely expensive to live. If you want to spend a while in Singapore, London, Sydney, or other cities with a high cost of living, it can be challenging to find something lower than $1,120/month. Unless you don't care if there's running water

But here's the thing: **it can still be less expensive than your lease.**

## Take Advantage of Averages

For argument's sake, let's assume the place in London costs $2,000/month. You're out of pocket an additional $880 for the month over what you would have spent in your lease.

You can make this affordable, though: by taking advantage of averages and renting less expensive places some of the time to offset higher costs in other locations.

For example, you can spend as little as $300/month for a [place to live in Chiang Mai, Thailand][2] — this is a place with wifi, air conditioning, and all the amenities.

If you were to spend half your year in low-cost cities like Chiang Mai and Prague, and the other half in more expensive cities, you might schedule something like this:

* January and February in Chiang Mai.
* March, April, and May in Barcelona.
* June and July in Zagreb.
* August in London.
* September and October in Paris.
* November and December in Ho Chi Minh City.

Using [Google Flights][3] to determine the cost of flights, and [Airbnb][4] to determine the average cost of renting a place for a month, this comes out to an average $1,033/month.

This is a savings of about $1,000 for the year when compared to my costs in Missoula.[^sf]

And it's not just a $1,000 savings. **You're saving $1,000 by traveling to 6 countries instead of staying in Missoula, Montana.**[^mt]

## You'll Save on More Than Just Rent

In addition to the cost of a place to stay, keep in mind that *everything* is cheaper in a place like Thailand or Croatia.

Here's an example: in Thailand, an average meal — something like panang curry with pork, or fried rice with chicken — will cost 60–90 baht, which is USD $1.68–2.52 using the exchange rate at the time of writing. Compare that to cheap food in the United States: it costs USD $5.69 for a Big Mac meal at McDonald's.

That means you spend 2–3x less on every meal, even if you eat pretty cheaply.

If you cook, the savings stay consistent. A dozen eggs is 40 baht (USD $1.12).

So in addition to saving $1,000 each year on rent, you will also spend less on food, entertainment, and nearly everything else when you stay in less expensive countries.

And we haven't even started talking about tax breaks yet — we'll get to that in the next chapter.

The big takeaway here is that you can save an unbelievable amount of money by traveling full-time and taking advantage of less expensive areas.

## You Can Save Tons of Money by Traveling the World

It sounds completely counterintuitive, but it's true: you can save a *ton* of money by giving up your lease and renting apartments from sites like Airbnb around the world.

To recap: once you've factored in the rest of the costs of living there, a $675/month lease in Montana is more expensive than renting apartments around the world for a year.

This isn't the result of a complex scheme to save money. It doesn't even require making sacrifices. In fact, you can afford to get *fancier* places, eat out every meal, and go on tourist-bait adventures like feeding elephants and snorkeling, because average costs drop, and your money goes further.

So remember: the next time you need to save up for a big expense, consider the traveling the world.

[^math]:
    Yay! Math!

[^cleaning]:
    I hate cleaning toilets and scrubbing floors, so I build the cost of a biweekly cleaning into my rent. If you haven't tried this, I can't recommend it highly enough — *especially if you live with someone else.*

[^cheaper]:
    Also worth noting are the more than 20 listings under $675/month.

[^airbnbcleaning]:
    If the cleaning isn't explicitly covered, you can usually negotiate a small additional fee to add that in before you finalize the stay.

[^sf]:
    The numbers get crazier: someone living in San Francisco, where the median rent is about $3,000, would save about $28,800 each year by traveling the world. That's fucking nuts.

[^mt]:
    Montana is wonderful. . .for 3 months each year. The other 9 are something [like this][5].

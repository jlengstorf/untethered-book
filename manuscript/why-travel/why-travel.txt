# Why Travel?

This book is designed to give you a list of the gear and strategies used by a real-world, long-term traveler. They're not the only solutions available, and they may not all be the best match for your traveling style.

That being said, I've been living by these strategies, using this gear, for nearly a year. And I've never felt more in control, more fulfilled, or more energized.

As I started writing this book, I thought about pulling in some inspirational quotes about travel, and why it's worth doing. But, look: you've already seen all that shit on Instagram, so I skipped it here.

I will, however, ask you to consider this: can you think of *any* activity or experience that gets as much positive press as travel? Outside of general motivational and self-love posts, there's nothing making the aspirational rounds more prominently than quotes about what travel does for your mind, your worldview, and your soul.[^soul]

[^soul]:
    In this context, let's assume "soul" means, "the intangible, innermost corners of your awareness, where our feelings are felt before they're cut to pieces by our analytical minds."

This book was written to provide practical, actionable advice — as such, I'm leaving out half the story. Knowing *how* to travel is important, but it's nowhere near as important as *actually booking your trip*.

Don't fall into the planning trap. Don't put it off until later; there will always be a "better time" in the future, or a reason to stay.

You've probably seen dozens of quotes like this, advocating wanderlust on top of beautiful scenery on Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest, and it's likely they barely registered — because, like most universal wisdom, it's had its teeth knocked out by decades of abuse from well-meaning dreamers.

Just remember, as you're gathering information and considering making a change, that **all the plans, theories, and research in the world are worth nothing unless you take the first step.**

## Too Much Preparation Is Procrastination

As a kid, I used to plot elaborate scenarios for my toys. I had a couple hundred Matchbox cars, and I'd spend hours taking them out, thinking up a story line, and placing them in exactly the right position.

Usually, by the time I was finished, my friends had left because it was so boring, I'd lost interest in actually playing, and it was time for me to clean up my toys and go to dinner.

My perfect scenario had become such a burden to prepare for that it never actually came to be. It faded as a near-completed project that was abandoned due to the tragic combination of fading passion and Mom's White People Enchiladas™.[^mwpe]

[^mwpe]:
    A recipe for Mom's White People Enchiladas™:

    3 frozen chicken breasts, cooked and cubed  
    4 large flour tortillas  
    1 can cream of mushroom soup  
    2 cups Monterey Jack cheese

    Roll chicken and cheese inside the tortillas and place in a baking pan. Cover the whole thing in cream of mushroom soup, and top with the remaining cheese. Bake until it's bubbly.

    Mom's White People Enchiladas™ — for the "adventurous eater" scared to eat anything new.

As an adult, I find myself using this "get it all perfect before I start" approach when I want to avoid actually *doing* whatever it is I'm planning for.

You will *never* feel 100% prepared. Everything new I've ever tried has been terrifying the first time, regardless of how much preparation I've done beforehand.

So don't put off your plans until you feel "ready" — you can only feel ready once you've proven you can do it. And the only way to prove it is to do it.

## Real-World Experience Is Not Optional

We've just spent a hundred pages or so covering a huge amount of information. You may feel overwhelmed. But don't let that worry you or slow you down. Traveling is a skill, and like any skill it requires hands-on practice before it starts to feel comfortable.

In fact, if you remember *nothing* from this book, but you take your first real-world step toward making your dreams happen, you'll be better off than if you never left, but memorized every fact and tip covered here. The truth is, we're living in a world that loves overthinking and intellectual understanding, but that downplays the value of practical experience.

But really, who has a better feel for Costa Rica: the person who's read every article ever written about Costa Rica (but has never been), or the person who's lived there for a year?

We can't intellectually grasp how it feels to _do something_. It's impossible to know what food tastes like by looking at pictures of it. In the same way, we can't become experienced travelers by reading about travel. We learn the most by *doing* — so we have to get out there and *do things* before we'll feel like we know what we're doing.

Imagine tight-rope walking. (And, for the purposes of this analogy, let's assume I know how to walk on a tight-rope.)

I can write hundreds of thousands of words about tight-rope walking, detailing dozens of strategies, techniques, and tips. I could wring every ounce of expertise out of myself in perfectly accessible language for aspiring tight-rope walkers.

And you could read everything I wrote and learn every word by heart. You could watch experts' performances and study them obsessively. You could become the world's foremost scholar on proper tight-rope walking technique.

But in the end, you still wouldn't be able to get on a tight-rope and walk.

Before you could do that, you'd have to stand up on the rope, feel your balance, notice the way your feet feel when you're stable, learn to anticipate the way your body will move as your balance shifts, and *walk a tight-rope*. With all the falls and mistakes along the way.

You actually have to *practice* the things you want to learn.

If you want to learn a language, you have to speak it — even though you'll make lots of mistakes before the pronunciation and grammar starts to make sense.

If you want to become a surfer, you have to paddle out into the waves — even though you'll fall a few times before you learn how to stand up on the board.

And if you want to travel the world, you have to *leave* — even though you don't know exactly what's out there waiting for you.

## Is It Really Scary? Or Just Unfamiliar?

Fear is an emotion that humans developed a long time ago to alert us to danger. However — let's be honest — aside from the odd bad driver, there's just not that much *real* danger left in the world for humans in western society.

So, in the absence of mortal threats, fear has evolved for many of us. Instead of alerting us to danger, it's started alerting us to anxiety, which doesn't signal much more than our own lack of comfort and experience in a situation.

Remember the first time you tried to ride a bike? Or the first time you rode mass transit? What about the first time you drove a car with a manual transmission?[^manual] In each case, the unfamiliarity of a new situation probably tripped all sorts of fear alarms, and your body made its best effort to curl into the fetal position and give up before even trying.

[^manual]:
    If you can't drive a stick, did the thought of it just cause you to tense up a little? That's exactly what I'm talking about.

The apprehension and urge to flee are holdouts from a time when it was likely that the things we weren't familiar with could (and wanted to) eat us. The new thing arrived, instincts kicked in, and we ran like hell to a safe distance where we could mull over our newfound knowledge. These days, though, new situations rarely have teeth, and in an increasingly child-proofed world, the likelihood that new experiences will harm us is pretty low.

And rationally, we know this. It's hard to be *rationally* convinced that we'll die if we ride the subway. But we're not thinking about things rationally. Instead, we're feeling our ancient brain's instinctive panic at unfamiliarity, which causes us to perform our most uniquely human (and ironically self-deceptive) act: we attempt to predict the future.

Humans have a unique ability in that we can *imagine* things. We can run hypothetical scenarios in our heads and come to hypothetical conclusions that will affect the rest of our hypothetical lives.

Unfortunately, our forecasting abilities are faulty at best, and self-destructive at worst. People are biased toward negativity — if we *can* imagine a bad outcome, we'll convince ourselves it's the *only* outcome — so when we look at a bike or a subway platform, we predict oncoming traffic and gruesome head injuries, or perverts in trenchcoats and years of trauma therapy.[^what-we-see]

[^what-we-see]:
    More likely, the prediction isn't clear at all. It's more likely to manifest as a vague sense of dark black dread and foreboding, utterly lacking in concrete detail, plausibility, or any reasonable tether to reality.

But if we trust ourselves to survive, we can push through the first experience. Then the second. And by the third, it's not so sphincter-clenchingly terrifying anymore. By the tenth, it's just another thing we do without a moment's hesitation.

Big experiences are no different: learning a new language, living in a new country, starting a new job, or even jumping out of airplanes — at first, it's horrible and terrifying and too big to even consider, but after gaining some experience, it's just another thing we do.

# Take Away Your Safety Nets

As a kid, I never seemed capable of holding on to money. My parents gave me my allowance, and it was gone the same day. On my birthday, I'd tear open all the cards and collect the money inside[^grandma] and figure out how to spend it *all* within the week.

[^grandma]:
    Each year I plotted ways to convince my elderly relatives that I was aging a decade at a time. "I'm sorry to be a stickler, Nana, but it looks like this check for $12 is missing a zero."

But I didn't have to care. After all, I was a minor — I knew my parents would go to jail if I starved to death. So I just whined to my mom until she slipped me $10.

My relationship with money changed when I was 18. I had just dropped out of college and moved back in with my parents. This, in my world, signified a major defeat. I'd failed on a quest to become a *bona fide* adult, and I was now back in my parents' basement.

Out of my embarrassment, I made a decision: I was going to become self-sufficient, no matter what. I told my parents that I wouldn't accept any money from them, and if I *did*, I wanted to pay it back — with interest — as a loan.[^dad-loan]

[^dad-loan]:
    My dad loved this idea, and he gleefully set up a spreadsheet to calculate the compounding interest and late fees and everything. In fairness, though, he cut me a huge break on the interest rate, which I appreciated.

And that changed things for me. Suddenly I wasn't playing with a failsafe anymore. This was *my* money; if I did a shitty job managing it, I had to pay interest to bail myself out.

Almost overnight, I became less-than-terrible with money. (It would take me another decade to become good with it.) The absence of a safety net forced me to learn budgeting, self-restraint, and financial planning — skills I'd previously ignored because there I had no need to learn them.

The same thing happened when I became a freelancer: I'd been holding onto my day job, fearful of what might happen if I couldn't land enough business as a freelancer. Then — my confidence buoyed by a three-month contract that would cover my bills with just enough left over for ramen noodles — I cut the cord. After quitting my job, it was like prospective clients could smell that I was serious. Within days, I'd landed another contract; by the end of the second month, I had matched the monthly income from my former day job — and the trend has continued steadily upward ever since.

By taking away the safety net — the "just in case" option — I was forced to commit to the path I really wanted to be on. And in the absence of any other option, I made the necessary steps to succeed.

Entrepreneurs talk about a need to "be hungry" to succeed. I'm not so sure that's a metaphor; when your options are "make this work" or "choose between buying groceries and paying the bills", the extra motivation to make it happen is easy to find.

To really take a plan seriously, it's critical to put all our efforts into making that plan work. I *don't* mean to put yourself at massive financial or personal risk for the sake of an idea, but I do mean that we can't really focus on Plan A if half our time goes toward keeping Plan B on track.

If you know what you want, you have to go for it. Hedging your bets beyond "make sure I don't end up on the street" is not a "smart" play, or a "responsible" decision — it's another way to sap energy from your ultimate goals. Consider what you're *not* willing to risk, and protect it. But anything that doesn't make that list can (and should) be risked in the name of getting what you want.

Don't take stupid risks, but don't make the assumption that all risks are stupid. After protecting the basics, the stupidest thing to risk is nothing at all.

# Don't Discount the Wisdom of Our Elders

Every year or so, this story starts circulating on social media about [the regrets of the dying](http://bit.ly/1R1F4BV). And the regrets are heartbreaking:

1. I wish I'd lived a life more true to myself, instead of living the way others expected me to live.
2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish I'd let myself be happier.

This book was born out of my efforts to avoid four of these five regrets: by taking a chance on something I really wanted for myself, I'm attempting to live a life true to what I want; to use work only as a means to achieve that lifestyle; to share what I'm learning and feeling as I go through this adventure; and to remind myself every day — whether I'm looking over a beautiful beach while I'm writing, or cooking breakfast with hot dogs because I couldn't find breakfast meat at the corner store — that I can't possibly imagine a life I'd rather be living right now.

You have dreams, and you have choices. You deserve to live a life you'll be proud to look back on. You deserve to [find happiness on your journey](http://lengstorf.com/finding-happiness/).

And the only person who gets to make the choice about what your life will look like in retrospect — what you'll remember on your own deathbed — is you.

You're [the hero and the author of your story](http://lengstorf.com/stories/). And I hope this book will play a small part in helping you write a good one.

# What's Next?

Making the transition to a life of long-term travel is no small task, but I hope this course has shown that it's far from impossible.

The workforce has changed, and a travel-based lifestyle is not only possible now, but it's *more practical* for both workers and employers. Long-term travel is not only an immensely rewarding experience, it's *cheaper to live abroad than to rent an apartment in Montana*.

You can travel solo. You can travel with a partner, like I do. You can even travel with children.

All you have to do is give yourself permission to do it, and take the first step. And then the next.

See you on the road,  
Jason Lengstorf

# Keeping in Touch While Abroad {#communication}

As you get ready to leave the country, it's a good idea to figure out how to keep in touch with people without paying a fortune for international calling.

It's also not a bad idea to figure out how to get a local number and access to wireless data.

## Keep a U.S. Phone Number and Get Free International Calling and Texting {#communication-us-number}

The first challenge I found myself up against was tricky: **how could my friends and family get in touch with me using a local U.S. number while I was outside the country?**

My mom can barely handle texting, so I couldn't just tell her to download a messaging app.[^mom-tech] Besides, my friends don't all agree on which app to use. Some prefer WhatsApp; others use Snapchat; and then there's the Facebook Messenger crowd. And I'm usually woefully unaware of which apps are trendy; there are probably lots more that I've never heard of.

[^mom-tech]:
    Asking my mom to do anything new with technology only ever ends with her in tears and me receiving a call from my very angry father. I think I'm still in trouble from the Great iTunes Meltdown of 2007.

I've resisted messaging apps[^whatsapp] because I prefer to consolidate my communication into calls and texts. I don't like having lots of notifications active on my phone, so having a half-dozen apps was less-than-ideal.

[^whatsapp]:
    I gave in and installed WhatsApp, which has been useful when we meet travelers who don't have local SIMs.

Google Voice turned out to be the perfect solution: it allows for voice and texting (including MMS), and I'd be able to keep a U.S. number while abroad.

Google Voice won't forward calls to a foreign number, which means my Thai SIM card can't get a call from Google Voice. However, if I have local data through the SIM card, that doesn't matter: calls and texts work through the Google Hangouts app over data.

The initial setup between Google Voice and Hangouts requires toggling some settings if you're using a custom domain, but once it's set up, it's as simple as using the regular calling and texting features of any phone.

The end result is a U.S.-based number that reaches me anywhere in the world just like a normal mobile number would: allowing me to receive calls *and* texts to the same place without spending a small fortune.

As far as my friends and family back in the States are concerned, nothing has changed about the way we communicate. I gave them my new Google Voice number, and no matter who dials, **no one has to worry about paying extra for the call.**

## Get a Local Number for the Country You're In {#communication-local}

Having a local number is really helpful when you want to make a reservation, book a tour, rent a car, or check the hours of a business. It's also good as a fallback for staying in touch with travel companions in case the network is too slow to send a message using data.

To get one, you'll need a local SIM card and an unlocked phone to plug it into.

A> A SIM card is a small chip that is inserted into your phone that allows it to connect to a given network. For most locked phones, you'll never see the SIM or hear any mention of it, which is why I'd never heard of them until a few months before I left the country. When you start using prepaid phones, each new country will require a new SIM card to access local mobile provider networks. Fortunately, they're easy to find: they're available at most corner stores, and there are small stores set up in most metropolitan areas that can sell you a SIM and activate it on the spot.

When I needed to call or text locally, I would use my local SIM — which just meant calling with the normal Phone and Messages apps on my iPhone.

## Use Free Video Calling Apps to Connect {#communication-video}

A standard complaint among people who travel long-term is that it gets lonely.

Not lonely in the traditional sense: you're surrounded by people. It's lonely in the sense that you're far away from anyone that you feel *close* to. And the odd phone call just doesn't seem to cut down on the isolation.

However, video calls seem to go a bit further toward creating a connection. Sure, nothing beats sitting down for a drink with a good friend, but seeing your friend on camera beats the hell out of sitting on your couch staring at a wall while you talk to them.

There are a ton of great options that offer a free way to connect with people on a video call.

If you're talking with a more tech-savvy friend, my favorite option is [Talky](https://talky.io/), which is a free, browser-based video chat.

Other options exist, but they require app downloads and/or plugin installs. Some of the most popular are [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/), and [FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/).

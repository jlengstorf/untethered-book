# Keeping in Touch While Abroad {#communication}

As we get ready to leave the country, it's a good idea to figure out how to keep in touch with people without paying a fortune for international calling.

While we're at it, we should figure out how to get a local number and access to wireless data.

## Keep a U.S. Phone Number Worldwide {#communication-us-number}

The first challenge I found myself up against was tricky: **how could my friends and family get in touch with me using a local U.S. number while I was outside the country?**

My mom can barely handle texting, so I couldn't just tell her to download a messaging app.[^mom-tech] Besides, my friends don't all agree on which app to use. Some prefer WhatsApp; others use Snapchat; and then there's the Facebook Messenger crowd. And I'm usually woefully unaware of which apps are trendy; there are probably lots more that I've never heard of.

[^mom-tech]:
    Asking my mom to do anything new with technology only ever ends with her in tears and me receiving a call from my very angry father.

I've resisted messaging apps[^whatsapp] because I prefer to do all my communication in one place: calls and texts. I don't like having lots of notifications active on my phone, so having a half-dozen apps was less-than-ideal.

[^whatsapp]:
    I gave in and installed WhatsApp, which has been useful when we meet travelers who don't have local SIMs.

At first, I thought Google Voice would be the perfect solution: it allows for voice and texting (including MMS), and I'd be able to keep a U.S. number while abroad. Perfect!

Except I can't forward Google Voice calls to a foreign number — this means my Thai SIM card can't get a call from Google Voice.

Then I looked at Skype numbers. These were promising: I could forward calls to my Skype number to a foreign number.

Except Skype numbers don't support texting.

So — because having two numbers seemed like a giant pain in my ass — I worked up a complex solution to what should have been a simple problem:

1. Get a Google Voice number — this is what I give to my friends and family to call and text.
2. Get a Skype Number and set the Google Voice number to forward to it.
3. Set the Skype Number to forward to my local SIM's number.

This is complicated, but it's the only way I could find to get a U.S.-based number to function like a normal mobile number would: allowing me to receive calls *and* texts to the same place without spending a small fortune.

## How to Get Free International Calling and Texting {#communication-international}

At first, I worried that I would have to choose between free[^free] calling within the country where I was staying, or free calling to the U.S.

[^free]:
    What I mean by "free" is "not charged at insane per-minute prices".

After a little digging, though, I realized I could have my cake and eat it, too. **Using [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), I could make free calls using wifi or mobile data to the U.S., and the caller ID would show my U.S.-based number.**

I could also send text messages (both SMS and MMS) on my phone.

It does require an extra app on my phone, but it doesn't require any of my friends to do extra work to keep in touch with me.

As far as my friends and family back in the States are concerned, nothing has changed about the way we communicate. I gave them my new Google Voice number, and no matter who dials, **no one has to worry about paying extra for the call.**

## Get a Local Number for the Country You're In {#communication-local}

Having a local number is really helpful when you want to make a reservation, book a tour, rent a car, or check the hours of a business. It's also good as a fallback for staying in touch with travel companions in case the network is too slow to send a message using data.

To get one, you'll need a local SIM card and an unlocked phone to plug it into.

A> A SIM card is a small chip that is inserted into your phone that allows it to connect to a given network. For most locked phones, you'll never see the SIM or hear any mention of it, which is why I'd never heard of them until a few months before I left the country. When you start using prepaid phones, each new country will require a new SIM card to access local mobile provider networks. Fortunately, they're easy to find: they're available at most corner stores, and there are small stores set up in most metropolitan areas that can sell you a SIM and activate it on the spot.

When I needed to call or text locally, I would use my local SIM — which just meant calling with the normal Phone and Messages apps on my iPhone.

## Use Free Video Calling Apps to Connect {#communication-video}

A standard complaint among people who travel long-term is that it gets lonely.

Not lonely in the traditional sense: you're surrounded by people. It's lonely in the sense that you're far away from anyone that you feel *close* to. And the odd phone call just doesn't seem to cut down on the isolation.

However, video calls seem to go a bit further toward creating a connection. Sure, nothing beats sitting down for a drink with a good friend, but seeing your friend on camera beats the hell out of sitting on your couch staring at a wall while you talk to them.

There are a ton of great options that offer a free way to connect with people on a video call.

If you're talking with a more tech-savvy friend, my favorite option is [Talky](https://talky.io/), which is a free, browser-based video chat.

Other options exist, but they require app downloads and/or plugin installs. Some of the most popular are [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/), and [FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/).

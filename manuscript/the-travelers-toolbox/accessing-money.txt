# How to Access Money Abroad Without Extra Fees {#money}

When you leave the U.S., some of the ease of banking gets left behind. For example, you'll rarely find a local branch of your bank in a foreign country.

So before you go, you'll want to make sure you can get to your money easily, without having to show up somewhere in person, and — most importantly — without paying huge penalties for accessing your accounts outside the country.

## Make Sure You Have EMV-Capable Cards {#money-emv}

Almost everywhere in the world except the United States is using [chip and PIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) (or EMV) for payments.[^chip-cards] This is because EMV is more secure and harder to forge than the swipe and signature approach.

[^chip-cards]:
    This is changing. U.S. card issuers announced a plan that includes shifting liability for non-EMV purchases as of [October, 2015](http://www.emv-connection.com/emv-migration-driven-by-payment-brand-milestones/), which should result in a mass migration of U.S. businesses to the new system.

The traditional U.S. method for paying with a card is pretty painful abroad. Some ATMs won't accept cards without chips. Many businesses won't be familiar with non-chip cards, and you may find yourself trying to explain how swiping works across dual barriers of culture and language, which... just call your credit and debit card issuers and ask for chip cards. You don't need the heartburn.

Most issuers are already sending chip cards, so if you call and ask you should have a replacement card within a week or two.[^replacements]

[^replacements]:
    When I replaced my cards, my card numbers didn't change. This meant I didn't have to update most of my recurring payments and stored payment methods for my various online accounts. The expiration dates did change, though, as well as the CVV codes. But overall, it was a pretty painless process.

## Learn About Foreign Transaction Fees {#money-extra-fees}

I grew up in Montana, where it was common for high school seniors to take weekend trips across the Canadian border — the drinking age in Calgary was 18 back then.

On one of these trips, my friend Phil used his debit card to pay for everything. A few days in, his card was declined. He did some mental math, felt like it had to be a mistake, and called his bank.

Turns out his bank charged an extra fee for every transaction: the *higher* of $5 or 3% of the transaction. He'd paid something like $100 in fees[^hssd] in just a couple days.

[^hssd]:
    Which in high school senior dollars brushes against the theoretical [limit of infinity](http://bit.ly/1EU0Mq0).

Don't be like Phil. Use a card that doesn't charge fees.

## Get Credit Cards Without Foreign Transaction Fees {#money-credit-cards}

If used responsibly, credit cards are actually a great way to make money. My credit card companies pay me upwards of $35 each month just for using the cards, thanks to the rewards programs they offer and the fact I pay them off in full each month.

But if I was paying foreign transaction fees, the rewards wouldn't be enough to cover it. So before I left, I switched to credit cards that met two goals:

1. Decent rewards that I could redeem for statement credit.
2. No fees for using the cards outside the U.S.

After a little research, I landed on two cards.

**1\. [Chase Sapphire Preferred](http://bit.ly/1PlaOEb)**

This is my main card. It's a Visa, so it's accepted basically everywhere, and the rewards are simple: 1% cash back for everything I spend.[^fancy]

[^fancy]:
    As a bonus, the card is made of metal or something, so it feels pretty fancy. I get to pretend I'm important when someone takes the card, weighs it in his hand, and gives the appreciative lip-purse-and-nod-with-eyebrow-raise.

The only catch with this card is the annual fee — but if you're paying it off at the end of each month, you'll make *way more* in rewards than you'll pay each year.

**2\. [Delta SkyMiles Platinum American Express](http://amex.co/1LpGdOU)**

This card used to be my main card. When I was in the U.S., it was hugely valuable to me because of the Delta bonuses. However, most of the countries I'm hanging out in these days aren't serviced (cheaply, at least) by Delta or its partners, so I'm not getting quite so much from the card.

In addition to no foreign transaction fees, it offers mileage bonuses, SkyMiles[^mqm] for all purchases, a companion ticket to bring someone along with you at no additional cost once a year, and other perks, like priority boarding.

[^mqm]:
    All the airlines are changing their mileage plans to suck a little more, so the SkyMiles are redeemable for flights, but they don't count toward your Frequent Flyer status. If you want to get that Platinum or Diamond luggage tag, your miles have to come from Delta flights.

Depending on your plans — basically, how much do you fly, and how much of that flying is done in the U.S. — this card may be worth the annual fee.

## Watch Out for Hidden Costs When Paying By Card {#money-hidden-costs}

When you pay with a card in some cities — especially cities with a strong tourism industry — the card reader may ask if you'd like to process the transaction in USD. It also makes the "no" option look really scary, like it'll cancel the transaction.

**Don't choose to pay in USD.** The exchange rate used is terrible, and you'll end up paying 1–5% more than you should.

Basically, this is something added by the card processors as a way to take advantage of clueless tourists. But you're going to save money by processing the transaction in the local currency, so press that scary "no" button and pay in Euros.

## Get Bank Accounts Without Foreign ATM Fees {#money-bank}

In many countries, paying by card just isn't an option. In Thailand, for example, the vast majority of businesses simply can't afford to pay the fees associated with credit card processing.

This means you'll need to pull cash out of an ATM.[^cash]

[^cash]:
    Also, it's just a good idea to carry some cash at all times for tipping and small purchases. I typically keep $100–200 in the local currency on me. That's enough to handle most unexpected trouble, but not so much that if I lose my wallet I'm going to be completely screwed.

Plus, if you're a remote worker, you'll need to be able to receive money into your account, deposit checks, and so on.

After a little research, I settled on a [Charles Schwab checking account](http://bit.ly/1NvejXS). It doesn't charge foreign ATM fees, pays a tiny bit of interest, and reimburses ATM fees charged by ATM owners.

Schwab focuses on online-only banking, which means it's perfect for those of us who won't be near a physical branch. Mobile check deposits are painless, and their customer support has been top notch whenever I have questions.

There are several options for fee-free banks in addition to Schwab. For, none of the other options worked as well for long-term travelers, but other companies have posted [reviews](http://nerd.me/1M3N57u) and [roundups](http://bit.ly/1PlaVQ2) that offer additional information if you'd like to check out your options.

## Be Aware of ATM Skimming and Protect Yourself {#money-atm-skimming}

Unfortunately, there's a fringe population of utter shitbags in the world. And because these shitbags exist, the rest of us need to be mindful of what's going on around us so we don't end up inadvertently funding one of these shitbags' way of life.

One brand of shitbag behavior to be aware of is called "ATM skimming" — in a nutshell, the shitbag places a small device over the top of the ATM's card reader that "skims" your card info, then uses a small camera to catch your PIN.

You can prevent this with a few simple precautions:

1. Try to use ATMs at banks when possible, because there are typically security cameras to discourage this kind of nonsense.
2. Jiggle the card reader. If it feels loose, don't use the ATM. Better safe than sorry.
3. Look for anything weird near the ATM, like a plastic container full of flyers. If you see one, check the sides and bottom for a camera.
4. Cover your hand while you enter your PIN. That way a camera can't see the PIN anyways.
5. Use ATMs that are on more heavily trafficked streets. The ATMs on little side roads don't have very much supervision.

There's no reason to be paranoid — this happens in the U.S., too — but be aware that it exists. Keep an eye on your accounts[^mint] to see if anything you don't recognize comes out, and set sane daily withdrawal limits ($500 or less from ATMs, for example) on your cards.

[^mint]:
    I use [Mint](http://bit.ly/1ilmKYZ) to monitor all my accounts in the same place. Every few days I check my transactions and balances to make sure I've got a grip on where I stand financially.

You can't guarantee no one will get their hands on your info, but you *can* guarantee some asshat won't clean you out in a single day. Again: better safe than sorry.

## Use Apps to Send and Receive Money Free {#money-apps}

Since I'm traveling with a partner, we end up splitting a lot of our expenses. To make sure things even out, we occasionally need to send each other money.

To avoid dealing with cash while also avoiding fees, we turned to apps that allow us to make transfers for free.

Our preference is the [Square Cash](https://cash.me/app/XJKFMJG) app, but there are lots of options now for sending money between family and friends without fees.

Some of the most popular are:

- [Square Cash](https://cash.me/app/XJKFMJG)
- [Google Wallet](https://www.google.com/wallet/)
- [PayPal](https://paypal.com)
- [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/919479321397007)
- [Venmo](https://venmo.com/)
- [Snapchat Snapcash](https://support.snapchat.com/ca/snapcash)

Another advantage of these apps is paying friends back home to help out with something. I had a friend handle something on my behalf back in the States, and with Cash I was able to pay him back instantly from Croatia — no dealing with wire transfers or figuring out how to get a check sent internationally.

## Don't Carry All Your Cards at Once {#money-diversify}

When I leave the house, I have one credit card, one debit card, one form of ID, and some cash. My other cards, ID, and cash stay in my apartment.

I *don't* have some secret cash pouch strapped to my body. I just carry my wallet and phone, and conduct my business like I would back in the States.

Muggers and pickpockets don't worry me much; I steer clear of situations where I'd be isolated, and I carry things in my hands instead of my pockets.[^carry]

[^carry]:
    I actually carry my wallet in my hand, along with my phone and keys. I stopped carrying things in my back pocket years ago because it's bad for my posture, and I stopped using my front pockets after I noticed a phone-shaped wear pattern in a pair of jeans.

However, in the unlikely event that I *do* get mugged or pickpocketed, I have a backup card, a little cash, and a form of ID back at the apartment. And vice versa: if something happens at the apartment, I'm carrying cards, cash, and ID.

This is a small way of ensuring that things can only go *mostly wrong*. Kind of a physical manifestation of the "don't keep all your eggs in one basket" philosophy: don't keep all your assets in one pocket.

# The Crap We Carry {#minimalism}

The worst thing about clichés is that they mean nothing — right up until the moment they mean *everything*.

One of the best pieces of advice I ever received was, **"Value experiences over things."** So let's say I turn around and tell you the same thing.

What does it mean?

Probably not a whole lot. It's a platitude. A cultural truism.

Of *course* we should do that.

Clichés like this one have been around so long that they've become part of the scenery. We grow up hearing "believe in yourself" and "be the change you want to see in the world" and "do one thing every day that scares you" and **the words are so well-worn and comfortable and familiar that they mean nothing.**

For me, clichés tend to gain meaning in reverse: I hear them and they mean nothing; then I act on them and they mean everything.

That's what happened for me with "value experiences over things." I'd heard it a thousand times, but I was still saving up to buy a custom end table to accentuate the handmade throw pillows I'd snagged on Etsy.

Then I realized my [working style was killing me](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a). Shortly after that, a long-term relationship ended. I found myself in a strange position: the two biggest influences on my life both disappeared within a few months of each other, and I was alone and without direction for the first time in years.

**I found myself questioning every aspect of my life.** What did I *really* want? Did any of what I was doing actually matter?

I spiraled further and further out of control until it all culminated in an if-not-now-when moment during my third or fourth day sulking amidst delivery pizza boxes and a *Suits* binge.[^suits]

[^suits]:
    I watched every episode available on Amazon Prime. I know. *I know.* I'm not proud of it; I was in a dark place, okay?

So I did something drastic: I bought a one-way ticket to Milan.

The subsequent struggles with selling, giving away, and donating all my possessions felt different than I'd expected. **Instead of losing pieces of myself, I started to feel more like myself than I had in over a decade.**

![](/images/everything-i-own.jpg)

And then I found myself on a plane over the Atlantic with [no return ticket](http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/).

That's when I felt the full impact of the cliché, and understood its weight and shape — the way it sounded before it tumbled across millions of tongues and teeth and had its edges worn smooth.

I'd been worrying about *stuff* when I should have been worrying about *stories*. Valuing things over experiences. Sonofabitch.

That's the irony, I guess: clichés only mean something after we're already following the advice.

# The Problem with Stuff

You'd think — given the relative absence of real problems that most First World knowledge workers face — that we'd all feel pretty chipper most of the time. The comfort of knowing we're sheltered and fed and surrounded by a small mountain of treasures ought to wrap us up like a soft, warm blanket; it should gently sing us to sleep, to dream untroubled dreams about how truly fortunate we are to have been born into a culture that allows us to [tap on a box of flashing lights in exchange for our meals](https://xkcd.com/722/).

And maybe most First World knowledge workers actually *are* pretty content.

In 2013, though, I sure as shit wasn't.

I had a 60" plasma HDTV that I *hated* because it was pre-2010. I owned maybe a dozen pairs of shoes, but I hated them all because they weren't Frye boots or limited edition leather Converse All-Stars. I was plotting to replace my reclaimed barn wood coffee table with a different reclaimed barn wood coffee table because — and I wish I was joking here — because the one I had *wasn't made by hand in the United States.*[^holier-than-thou]

[^holier-than-thou]:
    Before I spiral too far into the holier-than-thou, let me be perfectly clear: I still like having nice things. I'm not advocating some kind of austere, bare-walls existence.

    What I *am* advocating is the offloading of *useless* junk.

I always had my sights set on some new object of desire: a waxed cotton jacket; a hat that wouldn't make me look like goddamned Indiana Jones[^dr-jones]; a bespoke topcoat.

[^dr-jones]:
    My head is enormous, so when I wear hats they tend to look either comically small or entirely theatrical.

**I made more money than I'd ever made before, and somehow I was still in debt — still living paycheck to paycheck.**

## Stuff Should Fill a Need, Not a Void

My pursuit of more and better stuff snuck up on me. I don't remember making the decision to become an avid consumer. I just continued living my life, letting my decisions drift with my mood, lost in the dreamy haze of "getting by" — and then I woke to find myself in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, rationalizing a $5,000 Ermenegildo Zegna peacoat that I'd have to spread over several credit cards.

The need to get the best things I could afford — or, rather, the best things I could buy on credit — tugged at the edges of my identity like a petulant toddler. The urge to upgrade my wardrobe felt visceral; my idiot lizard brain strong-armed me into ogling Herman Miller furniture with the same hungry insistence that drew my eyes to every low neckline in a given room.

![Damn, baby, is that *lumbar support*?](/images/herman-miller-embody-chair.jpg)

Consuming is a cultural imperative, after all. Everything I watched on TV showed me glamorous people with fancy things attending sexy parties and living happy lives. The clear message was, "Are you sad? It's because you don't own the right shit. Get to shopping, you mopey fuck!"

And I *was* sad.[^sad] I'd hit a milestone where I'd run out of real goals: I wanted to work for myself — check; I wanted to build a company that could run without me — check; I wanted to live in a nice apartment in a cool neighborhood — check.

[^sad]:
    Actually, "sad" is the wrong word. More like "disenchanted" or "bored". Nothing has ever *actually* been sad about my life. On a scale of 1–10, where 1 is "my ice cream fell on the ground," and 10 is "I've experienced deep personal loss and hardship," my cumulative lifetime sadness tops out at, like, a 3.

Let's call it saddish, because it's the kind of bullshit malaise you can only feel in the absence of any real problems: **I had set out to achieve something, I'd achieved it, and now the outward thrust of my ambition pushing past the edge of my goals had created a vacuum.**

And in the absence of a new goal, I started stuffing the void full of credit card debt and useless junk.

## Breaking the Dependency on Stuff

Left unchecked, my pursuit of more and better crap may have buried me entirely. Fortunately, the twin shitstorms of a career crisis and a failed relationship forced me to think about what I was doing, and why.

I didn't actually make a choice to get rid of my stuff. Not really. I never sat down and thought out, rationally, "You know, I should really get a hold on this rampant consumerism." Nothing that level-headed was going on, here.

Instead, I made the *choice* to change my priorities: to travel while I still had the freedom and inclination to do so. And travel comes with a set of restrictions: I wanted to try for some crazy tax breaks, which required me to be gone for a year, which meant I'd need to give up any property in the United States, which meant I had nowhere to keep my stuff, which meant getting rid of all the stuff I didn't feel like carrying.

I chose to prioritize my dream of travel over my inertia-driven collecting. So my decision had nothing to do with a sudden burst of anti-consumerist energy, or a realization that the things I was buying didn't bring me happiness — it was a byproduct of a change in my plans.

Listing all of my things for sale was stressful. I got angry because everyone wanted to haggle on price. I was annoyed because I bought this stuff thinking I'd have it forever. I was sad because it sort of felt like I was selling off pieces of myself.

But then it was gone.

**I didn't own anything I didn't *absolutely need* daily. And it felt *fucking awesome*.**

I didn't feel like I'd traded any of myself. If anything, it felt easier to do exactly what I wanted to do. When I left for Italy, I didn't have to worry about my car, or my guitar, or my apartment — because I didn't *have* a car, a guitar, or an apartment.

My responsibilities were limited only to what I chose to keep: my job, my girlfriend, my suitcase full of clothing and electronics, my relationships with friends and family back home.

It felt like learning to fly. Like seeing color after an entire life spent in black and white. **Nothing had really changed, but everything was different now.**

# Our Emotional Baggage Is Worse Than Clutter

Throwing out all the shit I didn't need was only the beginning of my decluttering. Sure, removing all the extra junk I'd been accumulating in the unused recesses of my closets and drawers created the possibility for me to make a big change in my life, but there was another step:

**Before I could convince myself I was able to leave, I needed to drop a lot of emotional baggage.**

I needed to jettison the psychological dead weight that was holding me back; I needed to make room in my identity to become the kind of person who went on grand adventures.

## We Create Characters for Ourselves That Control Our Actions

Our lives are a series of stories starring us. We're the hero, the antihero, the protagonist. It's up to us to make those stories interesting.

And I don't mean "interesting to other people". **We need to make our stories interesting *to ourselves*.** Our ability to amuse strangers is just a pleasant side effect.

It didn't do so well in the box office — and maybe it's because the story is all heart and no substance — but one of my favorite movies of the last few years is *The Secret Life of Walter Mitty*.

![*The Secret Life of Walter Mitty*](/images/walter-mitty.jpg)

The reason I like this movie so much is that it shows a guy who's spent his whole life dreaming about things he'd like to do, and until the beginning of the movie, he's done *nothing* but take safe bets.

Then he gets a little push, and suddenly he decides that he *can* go do all that stuff. Nothing's stopping him.

So he goes. And he has an adventure. And he learns things about himself.

And while the movie has a lot of over-the-top elements, the heart of the story says that **anyone who's ever dreamed of doing something extraordinary is only limited by their willingness to make it happen.**

## Our Past Experiences Become Cages and Roadblocks

Imagine a friend comes to you and says, "I've got this opportunity: if I put a little work in, and stay focused, I can make a living from wherever I have my laptop — I could finally see Budapest! But it seems really scary. What do you think I should do?"

What's your advice to your friend? If the opportunity seems legitimate, you're going to tell them to go for it. Do the work! Make it happen! You only live once, right?

So here we are, at the exact same moment — except instead of your friend, it's *you* who has this opportunity.

**Did your advice suddenly lose validity now that you're the one receiving it?**

It's easy to feel like a special case. Like somehow — because you're *you* — things will happen differently than they would for anyone else.

So we tell our friends to chase their dreams and take chances — but we hedge our bets and only make safe plays.

But we're not a special case. We're not different. We will get the same benefit from following our own advice.

If we never test our limits, we'll never realize they don't exist.

## The Desire to Be Consistent Overrides Rational Thought

"Reinvention" sounds big.

If I think of reinventing myself, I picture triumphant synth music, quick dissolves between one-armed push-ups and punching frozen sides of beef, and emerging out the other side a bigger, faster, stronger version of myself.

But actual reinvention is much simpler, and decidedly less exciting.

For example, I used to hate wearing shorts, so I didn't like warm weather. For years, this prevented me from going to beaches, waterparks, and southern California. But then I decided I wanted to go to Thailand, where it's hot. This presented a challenged, because meant I'd need to wear shorts. So I decided that, from now on, it was okay to wear shorts since doing so allowed me to have something I wanted.

Boom! Reinvention!

That example sounds trite — and it is — but, really, almost every "obstacle" I've ever faced on the road to my happiness was actually a self-imposed restriction from a long time ago: I'd decided somewhere in the past that [Someone Like Me wouldn't do a thing like this](http://lengstorf.com/no-one-is-coming-to-save-you/). Nothing actually *created* that restriction. I just decided one day, "I like dogs," and so decided that cats were stupid since they weren't dogs. We laugh at the way little kids make snap judgments about things like broccoli, but we're similarly capricious in our long-lasting snap judgments about pretty much everything.

This comes from a psychological bias we're all guilty of: we want to be consistent with our decisions. The urge to be consistent is what makes us *absolutely sure* that our team is the best, or that the car we chose is better than all the others, or that our chosen groups (political, religious, dietary) are superior to the alternatives — we *have* to believe that, or we'd be crushed by the terror of having made suboptimal decisions.

The desire to be consistent is constant, and strong. But it's also optional and entirely self-imposed. We don't *have* to be consistent with who we've always been; that's just our default impulse.

So if you want to try something that doesn't fit in with who you think you are inside your story, imagine you're the star of an 80s montage and reinvent yourself — when you come out the other side, you're transformed, and *you can do anything you want.*

# We Get to Choose Who We Are Today

Our identities aren't set in stone. I wasn't born a bearded, code-writing, wanderlusting love machine — I worked hard to become all of those things.

![...and I don't work for nobody but you.](/images/jason-lengstorf-love-machine.jpg)

On the way to becoming what I am today, I've been a sad poet, an "oppressed" teenager, an overworked entrepreneur — I chose each of those identities, and discarded them when they no longer fit.

**We get to choose who we are today, and every day going forward.** The past is over; we get to choose which parts of it we'll drag around — and which parts we'll leave behind for good.

## You Have Total Control

When we really get down to it, your goals — becoming location-independent, traveling the world, being your own boss — aren't out of your reach. Tearing down walls to get where we want to go isn't hard, *if* you've given yourself permission to do it.

If you've ever jumped into water from somewhere high, you might remember the mental block you felt before the first jump.

As you stood at the edge, looking down, you carried out an internal debate. Sure, other people have jumped, and they're okay, but you think you might remember a story, maybe, about a kid who jumped and was attacked by a flock of seagulls mid-flight because he'd just eaten popcorn shrimp and was covered in shrimp-grease and, sure, you know it's probably not true and it sounds pretty unlikely (especially because you haven't eaten any shrimp) but, hey, why take unnecessary risks, right?

But then, finally, you jumped. And everything was fine.

Nothing changed between you frantically making excuses and jumping — except that you finally assumed responsibility, gave yourself permission, and *jumped*.

**You're in control. Always.** When you look down a potential path, there are no road blocks. No tollbooths or border guards.

**There's just you, and whether or not you're willing to give yourself permission to have what you want.**

So here you are, standing on the edge of an exciting new adventure. If you want to jump, remember what you'd tell a friend in your position:

**_Jump._**

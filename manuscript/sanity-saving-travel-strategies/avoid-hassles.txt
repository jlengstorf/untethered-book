# Avoid Travel Day Hassles {#avoid-hassles}

If you're planning to travel internationally — especially if you've never done it before — there are a few gotchas that can really fuck up your day.

Fortunately, they're all pretty easy to avoid. Most of them don't even require preparation; just being aware of what can happen is typically enough to steer away from stressful travel-day scenarios.

## Get Familiar with the Schengen Area {#avoid-hassles-schengen}

When I first started planning my travel, I intended to spend all of 2015 in Europe. I had looked up how long I could stay in Spain, and 90 days was the limit.

So I looked up Italy. Again: 90 days.

*This is going to be so easy,* I thought. *I'll just jump from country to country every few months.*

But I had it wrong.

Yes, you can stay for 90 days in Spain. And you can stay for 90 days in Italy. *However,* both Spain and Italy issue the same visa — so I couldn't go straight to Italy after three months in Spain.

This was a serious wrench in my shit.

After a little more research, I learned that the Schengen Agreement created — among other things — a common visa for *all* EU countries.[^almost] This common visa applies to what's known as the [Schengen Area](http://bit.ly/1UUkS5m).

[^almost]:
    The Schengen Area consists of all EU countries *except* Ireland, the United Kingdom, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus. Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland are also part of the Schengen Area.

    Ireland and the UK have opted out of common visas. The UK is really strict about their border, and Ireland didn't want to jeopardize its open border agreement with the UK. At least, this is what I was able to understand by skimming the Wikipedia article.

    Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus are all supposed to join the Schengen Area in the near future. They just have to prove their infrastructure meets EU standards first.

This is really convenient when you're visiting, or when you live in the EU: you can move between Schengen Area countries the same way U.S. citizens move between states: no border control and no hassles.

But for the long-term traveler, this poses a challenge: after your 90-day visa is up, you need to stay out of *all* Schengen Area countries for a 90-day period before you can enter again.[^rolling]

[^rolling]:
    The specifics of this are kind of weird to understand. The 90 days are figured on a rolling basis, so you can be present for 90 of the last 180 days. The easiest way to look at this is to go exactly 180 days backward from today, then add up all the days you were in an EU country. Is it fewer than 90 days total? [You're allowed to be there.](http://bit.ly/1UUkofy)

So if Europe is on your list, make sure your plans account for the Schengen visa. Depending on the time of year, you can jump over to Croatia or Romania for a less expensive option, or to the UK[^london-long-term] if you don't mind spending a little more on... everything.

[^london-long-term]:
    The UK is really only a good idea for a long-term stay if you like being wet, cold, and broke.

Or, if you don't mind a longer flight, Asia has a lot to offer. I've found that splitting my time between southeast Asia and Europe has been ideal for me, both in terms of my happiness and my bank accounts.

## Check If You Need a Visa Before You Go {#avoid-hassles-visa}

As Americans, tourist visas are often just given to us when we show up. That stamp in your passport? That's a visa.

But not all countries work that way. Thailand, for example, requires you to apply for a visa beforehand[^voa] if you want to stay longer than 30 days, and Turkey requires you to get a visa online before you fly.

[^voa]:
    You can get what's called a "visa on arrival", but it involves yet another line in the airport, and there's no guarantee you'll actually get one — it's a low-risk gamble, but when there's a 24-hour, three-connection flight involved, I'm not willing to leave *anything* to chance.

These visas also cost money. They're usually cheap — $20 for a 90-day Turkish visa, $80 for a double-entry (180-day) Thai visa — and you'll save so much staying in the country[^thaifood] that it's absolutely worth paying.

[^thaifood]:
    On Koh Samui in September, we had two orders of panang curry with pork, one order of fried rice with pork, and two bottled waters. It cost us 170 baht — that's less than $5 to feed two people. And those prices aren't abnormally cheap, either.

Before you book your flight and apartment, figure out how visas work for the country you're visiting. A quick search for "tourist visa for ________" will usually do the trick.

If you need to apply for a visa in person, figure out where a consulate or embassy for the country is. Plan on being there for at least three days, just in case the processing takes longer than expected. And check for holidays in both the country you're planning to visit *and* the country you're trying to get a visa to enter. You don't want to show up and find out they're closed.[^rome-thai-embassy]

[^rome-thia-embassy]:
    In Rome, Marisa and I put off going to the Thai embassy because it was across town and we had a stop between Italy and Thailand. A week before we left, we finally headed to the embassy in a taxi (because we were too lazy to walk). The entrance was tough to find, and it definitely didn't look open. Finally, I noticed a sheet of computer paper flapping over a callbox, letting us know that it was a Thai holiday and they were closed.

    Worried about the 2–3 business day processing time, we felt uncomfortable submitting applications any later than that day. Which meant we'd need to apply in Croatia. Except we were in Split, where there was no Thai consulate. Which meant we needed to take a side trip to Zagreb.

    It was a huge hassle, is the point I'm getting at, that we could have avoided by checking for holidays and going a day earlier in Rome.

I'm making this sound scary, but it's really not. Just read the requirements, jump through the hoops, and enjoy your 3–6 month visit.

## Don't Get Worked Up About Security {#avoid-hassles-security}

I can't handle inefficiency; it makes me crazy. Because of this, the airport security line is a special kind of hell.

There's the this-is-my-first-airplane guy, who holds up the line for several minutes while he learns, item by item, that "remove everything from your pockets" means *everything*. Yes, even gum. Yes even your boarding pass. Yes, even... goddammit, dude, just turn 'em inside out!

And then there's the we-pack-by-stuffing-all-our-shit-into-tote-bags couple. He's unpacking his *entire* carry-on because the laptop is at the very bottom, and she's not sure which pocket the liquids are in. Also, is an iPad a laptop? Or can that stay in the bag?

Meanwhile, I've been holding my watch, belt, and shoes since the second switchback in the security line, and my bag is packed in such a way that my laptop and liquids are out within ten seconds of setting my bag in a bin.

Marisa looks at me with concern, and reaches out to touch my arm with the same care and caution she'd use to disarm a bomb. "It's okay. We've got plenty of time before our flight," she reassures me.

"I don't give a fuck about our flight. I give a fuck about these idiots not having the common courtesy to give a few seconds' forethought to how this might go," I spit at her. "I give a fuck that they're so solipsistic they don't even have the capacity to feel ashamed about it."

So it goes: I let inexperienced or inconsiderate travelers get under my skin, and my stress response skyrockets, and minutes or hours or days of my life are lost in a self-inflicted rage; casualties of a war I can't help but wage on my body, using my endocrine system as a chemical weapon.

Marisa's right, after all: it doesn't matter if the tourists in matching outfits empty their bags onto the floor, or if the first-timer has to step through the metal detector three times before he gets everything out of his pockets. *It doesn't affect me.*

And I need to show a little empathy. I've been these people before. And I still am, on occasion.

In Costa Rica, I did my usual shoes-and-belt-and-electronics routine to get ready for security, and when I got to the front of the line, the security lady looked at me and said, "What are you doing? Put your shoes back on."

So I tried to put my shoes on quickly, but I was definitely holding up the line.

And I'm sure, somewhere behind me, a Costa Rican businessman's neck felt hot, and he checked his watch impatiently, muttering, "*¡Odio estos pinches turistas!*"

## Be Ready to Prove You're Planning to Leave {#avoid-hassles-onward-travel}

When we go through customs in a foreign country, it's the customs agent's job to make sure we're not going to do anything illegal while we're there.

The big fear is illegal immigration: if I show up in London on a tourist visa, then take a job under the table and just... don't leave, I'm putting a strain on the British system. My illegal job means there's one less *legal* job; it means fewer taxes are paid; it means I'm probably renting a place illegally (again, fewer taxes).

It's a legitimate concern to have, but it also makes long-term travel a red flag for customs agents.

As part of ensuring you're not going to do anything untoward, some customs agents will ask for proof that you're planning to leave. They call this "proof of onward travel" — typically your flight out of the country.

Usually, this isn't a problem; just make sure you have the email ready to show at customs if they ask.

But if you're not sure when you're leaving yet, you probably won't have your flight booked. Which means you can't prove you're planning to leave. Which means — in extreme cases — you could be denied entry into the country.

I've never personally run into this issue. I've only ever been asked for proof of onward travel in the United Kingdom, whose customs agents have a reputation for being hardasses.

So this may not ever be an issue for you. But if you're worried, make sure you've got a valid exit plan.

## Be Ready to Prove You Can Afford Your Stay {#avoid-hassles-proof-of-income}

In addition to proving you're actually going to leave, you may be asked to show that you have enough money to afford your stay. After all, if you show up on a tourist visa with $10 in your pocket, no savings, and no return ticket, how the hell will you leave without illegally taking a job?

The requirements are low in most places. Thailand, for example, requires that you have ฿10,000 (about US $280) for every 30 days you plan to stay. Somewhere like London may expect a higher sum, but I haven't been asked.

It might feel like an invasion of privacy, but think of it more like a security deposit: if you're about to lend someone your $1,000 guitar, you want to be sure they've got $1,000 to replace it in case it gets destroyed, right? Same idea here.

So be ready to show your bank account balance. This doesn't happen often (I've only had to do it once), but it's a possibility.

## Don't Overshare with Customs {#avoid-hassles-overshare}

I once told a customs agent I was technically homeless. He was not amused.[^amused]

[^amused]:
    Honestly, he must have been a little amused, because otherwise there's no way in hell I'd have been allowed in the country. He did, however, tell me to "never, *ever* say that to a customs agent again."

Remember the situation you're in: a customs agent can make your life *really* hard for a day or two, so play along and be nice. If you rub the agent the wrong way, they might grill you a little harder, and if you slip up, you could find yourself held for extra questioning.

Be polite. Be honest. But be *brief*.

When you show up in a country and plan to be working, *but that work is technically being performed in another country*, you're not taking jobs from locals. When I work on a contract with a Canadian company that pays money into my U.S.-based bank account, I'm not stealing a job from a Spanish citizen.

But I *am* working while in Spain.

Does that violate the tourist visa? Honestly — it seems to depend who you ask. The location-independent workers of the world — the WFHers, the digital nomads, the remote workers — exist in an as-yet undefined legal space.[^change]

[^change]:
    I suspect this will change in the future. But for now, thanks to ambiguities in the way remote work is defined, workers like us seem to have fallen through the cracks. What we're doing is perfectly legal, as far as I can tell, and no one has refuted my claims with anything other than different interpretations of the same murky wording that led me to believe it was legal.

    Since there aren't many people doing this, I doubt it's a high priority to clarify the language, but I expect we'll see it cleaned up within our lifetimes. So if you're planning to do this, do it now: who knows how long the big benefits (like tax breaks) will remain intact.

My personal stance on this is that as long as I'm putting money into a local economy and taking nothing out, I'm a tourist.

As far as the country I'm visiting is concerned, my money could just as well come from a trust fund, or a magic purse I won from a down-on-his-luck wizard; the point is that where I am has exactly *nothing* to do with how I make my living.

I believe this is logically correct, but I also hold no illusions about legal decisions being based in logic, so I take an incognito approach: I am a tourist; I am here on holiday; I do not plan to take a job in the country; I plan to leave before my tourist visa expires.

All of these statements are true. I leave out my internet-based business because global legislation hasn't caught up to the global economy. I don't want to engage government representatives in a rhetorical debate about where internet-based work "is" — so I keep my mouth shut and, if they probe about income, I show them my emergency fund to prove I can afford to be there.

# Sanity Saving Travel Strategies

Even as an experienced traveler, travel can be pretty stressful. Decisions about where to visit, where to live, and how long to stay are draining. Digging through embassy websites for visa information is a hassle. And no matter how many times I go through the process, airport security is still a soul-smothering clusterfuck.

In this section, we'll go over strategies to alleviate some of this stress, whether by using a tool, altering expectations, or simply becoming aware that certain hassles exist in the first place.

Because traveling — the act of traveling itself, as in the logistics and process of moving your body from one location to another — will probably always involve some stress, but it doesn't have to be awful.

# Book Travel Cheaply and Easily {#booking}

With the enormous amount of information available about booking travel, it can feel a little overwhelming. Hundreds of sites will book your travel for you, and — unless you've got a friend who's used the service before — it's impossible to know if they're any good.

So part of becoming a full-time traveler means becoming a part-time travel agent.

Fortunately, that's *way* easier than it sounds.

## Stay Long Enough to Really Enjoy Each Place (and Save Money) {#booking-stay-longer}

The world is a big place, and the temptation when traveling is to stuff as much of it as possible into each trip. People say things like, "I visited 8 countries in 6 days!" and show us photos of themselves in front of famous landmarks, but did they really *do* anything in those countries other than sprint between photo-ops?

Think about where you live now. Your favorite places: the side-street bar where the [bartender taught you](http://lengstorf.com/how-to-drink/) how to make an Old Fashioned the right way; the [food cart with a menu so eclectic](http://www.carteblanchefoodcart.com/) you were sure it'd be gross, but it ended up being the best food you've ever eaten for $10 a plate; the [coffee shop](http://www.wateravenuecoffee.com/) that's perfect to work from and just happens to be across the hall from a tasty [ramen spot](http://bokebowl.com/). Oh, and the [other ramen spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mirakutei-portland).

Chances are, few of your favorite places have been your favorite places since your first week in town. And they most likely don't top must-see lists on travel websites.[^voodoo]

[^voodoo]:
    If you search "what to do in Portland", you'll see Voodoo Donuts on almost every list. But most people living in Portland only go to Voodoo when their out-of-town friends are visiting. How many New Yorkers hang out in Times Square when they're not playing tour guide? How many Londoners are fighting through crowds to see Westminster Abbey?

If you only see a city based on a travel blogger's top ten list, you're not seeing the city; you're seeing *the tourists' version of a city.* Which, look, I've accepted that [being a tourist is okay sometimes](http://lengstorf.com/navigating-the-tourist-trap/) — but there's so much more to a city than its famous landmarks and whatever Anthony Bourdain did while he was there.

For me, this means that I want to stay in a city for at least two weeks, but preferably a month or more. And even that feels too short in a lot of cases.

With a month, you can see the tourist attractions without hurrying, *and* you can [actually get to know your neighborhood](http://lengstorf.com/discover-a-new-city/). Plus — remember, this isn't a vacation — a month means you have enough time to get work done without skipping bucket list activities or scrambling to cram multiple things into a single day.

As an added benefit, staying for a month will often mean discounted rates for accommodations. An apartment that rents for $40/night might rent for $900/month, which — don't worry, I won't make you do math — is a 25% discount.[^buy-3-get-1]

[^buy-3-get-1]:
    Or, to put it in discount shopper terms: rent 3 months, get 1 free!

Working remotely means you can travel slowly, taking the time to dig into each location. Since it's not a vacation, there's no need to rush. The goal of this whole thing, after all, is a *less stressful* lifestyle.

## Use Airbnb to Book Long-Stay Accommodations Hassle-Free {#booking-airbnb}

I'm a big fan of [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8), and so far in my travels I've booked nearly all my apartments through the service.

I like Airbnb for a few reasons:

1. It's typically _way_ cheaper than a hotel room.
2. Most listings are apartments, which means they're suitable for longer stays.
3. You're usually dealing with a single owner, so communication is friendlier and less stressful than calling an anonymous help desk number.

Plus, you can find Airbnb listings in areas that don't have much to offer by way of hotels, such as the West Village in Manhattan.

The big benefit, though, is that you can filter based on amenities. Need a washing machine and a full kitchen? Airbnb will only show listings that have those. Want to have a hostel-like experience[^hostel] and live on the cheap? Rent a shared room.

[^hostel]:
    The appeal of a hostel continues to escape me. People talk about them so fondly. They say things like, "you meet such great people," and "it's so cheap," and "you're bound to find something to do and a group to do it with."

    I hear that, and I think, *damn, that sounds like fun!* And every few years, I convince myself that I should try it again.

    All of my hostel experiences have gone something like this:

    17:02 — I stuff my shit into a tiny cubby and lock it with a padlock I bought from the front desk at check-in.  
    17:03 — It occurs to me the key to the padlock is inside my bag. Which is now safely inside the cubby.  
    17:11 — The stoned teenager working the front desk isn't strong enough to use the bolt cutters, but seems reluctant to let me help.  
    18:29 — A group of twenty-year-old backpackers from Europe talks to me about "living life authentically" before complaining that their parents won't send more money after next week, so they'll have to go home, they guess.  
    18:37 — I eat dinner by myself after declining to join the backpackers for pre-dinner shots.  
    22:41 — I try to position myself on the top bunk in a way that will prevent me from A) snoring and B) plummeting to the concrete floor.  
    23:38 — A girl who's evidently still on Tokyo time decides to deal with her insomnia by removing everything from her bag — by the sound of it, she's packed nothing but fun-sized potato chips and wrenches — and putting it back in again.  
    03:01 — A girl on London time follows in the bag-rattling footsteps of Tokyo Time. It sounds like she's packed bubble wrap and rusted hinges.  
    05:50 — I wake up sweating. There's no air conditioning and all the windows are closed.  
    05:53 — I take a cold shower and vow to never — *ever* — stay at a hostel again.

Plus, if you're staying for a month or more in each place, some Airbnb hosts offer discounts for longer stays. After all, they price with the expectation that the property will sit vacant for at least part of every month — you booking it solid ensures they're not losing money on unbooked weekdays.

You can check out long-term rentals easily at [airbnb.com/sublets](https://www.airbnb.com/sublets).

If you've never used Airbnb before, [you can save $20 on your first booking here](http://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8).

## Shop Locally for Cheaper Accommodations {#booking-local}

Talking to other people who travel full-time, the general consensus is that you can save extra money by looking for rentals in person. Many local folks don't know about or use Airbnb, so the cheapest rentals are usually found by wandering and asking around.

The strategy here is to rent a room for a few days at a hotel or hostel, then walk through the neighborhood looking for "for rent" signs.

During a recent stay in Thailand, we made the decision to stay for a couple months, switching from the north to the south side of Koh Samui at the midpoint of the trip. A week or so before the end of our first rental (found on Airbnb), we took a day trip down to Lamai and walked around to decide where we wanted to stay.

A major benefit of this approach is that you can see the place — and the neighborhood it's in — before you agree to pay. The other benefit is that you can potentially save a few hundred bucks a month.

In the case of Lamai, we found a place that was roughly the same as our first rental from Airbnb, in a more walkable neighborhood and with an ocean view, for $150 *cheaper* than the Airbnb rental.

Personally, I value "hassle-free" over "slightly cheaper", so if I can save 5% by doing a bunch of extra legwork, I'd rather just spend the extra 5%. If I hadn't already been on Koh Samui, I wouldn't have gone out of my way to go apartment shopping — I'd rather spend a little extra and not have to stress about it.

The ease of booking online — plus the extra protection of using a middleman to cover both renters and landlords — might make Airbnb worth paying a little extra. But if you're a deal-hunter, this is an opportunity to shave off a few extra dollars each month.

## How to Book Cheap Flights Without Wasting Time {#booking-flights}

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of booking sites that offer deals on flights. Depending on where you're planning to go, different sites will have better deals — so it makes sense to check them all when booking.

However, checking a dozen sites for cheaper flights is awful. It takes forever, and each of those sites will pepper you with ads and pop-ups and all the other things that make online discount shopping terrible.

Fortunately, there's a much better way to find flights, and it doesn't involve paying extra or spending extra time. In fact, it'll *save* both time and money.

With [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/), you can check prices across dozens of booking sites quickly. Where it really shows its value, though, is with the calendar and map views.

When you search a flight, you can pull up the calendar and see the lowest price for each day of the month. In the case of New York to London, the price fluctuates by hundreds of dollars throughout the month.

And if you're not sure where you want to go next, you can pull up the map view, enter your starting airport, and see cities you could visit next pop up along with the lowest-priced flight to get there.

So don't waste time going between Kayak, Priceline, Travelocity, and whatever other sites are advertising low prices. Use Google Flights (which searches those other sites, anyways) and get the cheapest flight possible in the least amount of time.

## Pay for Checked Baggage in Advance {#booking-checked-bags}

Airlines are all competing on price, and one of the ways they do that is by stripping away non-essential services from the base fare and turning them into add-on fees.[^scumbag] This is especially evident in Europe, where companies like Vueling, easyJet, and Ryanair offer flights for next-to-nothing.

[^scumbag]:
    The initial reaction to this may be, "Scumbag airlines keep adding new fees!" — but resist that urge. If charging for food means that my ticket gets a few dollars cheaper *and* I won't be handed some sugary, cookie-shaped, food-like product that I'll try (and fail) to stop myself from eating, I'm all for it.

Where they make their money, it seems, is by charging fees for little stuff most travelers don't think about. You only get one bag, and if you don't pre-pay for the second one they nail you for 2–3 times the fee at the check-in counter. Ryanair charges you to print your boarding pass (so do it beforehand). These penalty fees might make discount airlines seem like soulless profiteers, but really, they're cutting away every unnecessary cost to allow people who don't need it not to pay for it.

So, sure, they're maximizing profits, but they're doing it by lowering prices for savvy travelers. (By the way, that now includes you.)

To avoid getting hit with penalties, be sure to to read the details when you book tickets. What's the baggage limit? Do you need to print a boarding pass beforehand?

Make sure you know the rules, and you can ensure that your great airline deal *stays* great.

## Keep Dates Flexible to Save Money on Flights {#booking-flexible-dates}

Becoming location independent is all about freedom. An excellent use of your freedom is to travel on the days that work best for you *and* your wallet. If you can save $500 by waiting a couple days to fly, do it.

Take advantage of the Google Flights calendar view to see if there's a big fluctuation in price, and make sure you're not paying $500 for a flight on Friday that could be $200 for a flight on Monday.

The same applies to certain cities. Many places have "on" or "high" seasons, where tourism peaks and prices spike.

Sometimes, the high season makes a lot of sense: the lavender fields in Provence only bloom in August, for example.

Other times, missing the high season is downright eerie. On August 1, Rome looks a bit like the opening of *The Walking Dead*:

> You step into stifling heat. The air is heavy and still, settled over the city like an electric blanket. No one's there. There's no sign of trouble — things appear normal — but the streets are deserted. Steel shutters stand closed, hiding bars and shops until nothing remains of the street but a steel corridor, littered with handbills from struggling restaurants and square napkins from gelato shops.
> 
> Around a corner you hear shuffling. *Zombies aren't real,* you remind yourself, and step forward with a deep breath.
> 
> In the street, hundreds of dazed tourists amble along at a pace so slow it's practically reverse, eyes skyward, their absurd mountains of luggage occupying the entire sidewalk, clutching their selfie sticks in the shadow of the abandoned ruins of the Roman Empire.
> 
> In the corner of your vision, something flutters gently. One of the steel shutters has a piece of paper taped to it. The handwritten note reads, "*andati in vacanza fino al 1 settembre.*"

The reason the only people in Rome during August aren't from Rome is that — as far as I can tell, at least — the entire country of Italy takes August off from work and heads for the ocean. Those Italians who don't end up on the Amalfi coast show up in places like Split, Croatia, where August is a feeding frenzy for the tourism industry.

August is the high season in Split not because August is the only time it's worth going, but because *that's when the tourists show up*. There's really no other reason. July and September — while a bit hotter and cooler, respectively — are just as nice as August, but significantly less crowded. And cheaper.

If you're interested in a place, find out when the peak seasons fall. Then find out *why*. And decide if the why matters — because if you go in the off-season, you can save a fortune and see tourist attractions without the tourists.

Some of the best times tend to be the "shoulder seasons" — this is when the weather changes. For example, November in Costa Rica is the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the nice season. If you go during November, you gamble a little with the weather, but you'll also pay half (or less) for a hotel, and you'll have the beach almost entirely to yourself.

The takeaway from all this is to take advantage of your ability to work and live wherever and *when*ever you want. You can save a huge amount of money and stress by booking flights and accommodations when a destination is less expensive and less crowded, but no less fun to visit.
